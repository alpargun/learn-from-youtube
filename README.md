# Learn From YouTube Videos

This repository aims to create on-demand video datasets from YouTube, which can then be used to train video networks through self-supervised learning.
A .csv file with YouTube video IDs is enough to automatically download and preprocess all videos.
Additionally, all videos from a single channel/user can be downloaded automatically.


## TODO

- [x] Save youtube links
- [x] Implement video downloader
- [ ] Preprocessing for videos
- [ ] Implement video networks
- [ ] SSL training
- [ ] Evaluate on downstream CV tasks
- [ ] Evaluate on downstream RL tasks (Atari etc.) to test interacting with the world


## CV tasks:

- [ ] object detection
- [ ] segmentation
- [ ] facial recognition
- [ ] pose estimation
